# Arrays Mini Lab 3

## Directions

1. In app.js create an array called numbers and fill it with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

2. Use JavaScript's built in map function to divide all the numbers in half and store those values in a new array called halved.

3. Then run the tests from terminal by typing npm run test

## Resources

If you know what arrow functions are visit
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
and learn about the ES6 map method and use it to take an array of numbers and return a new array where each value is exactly half the size of the values in the original array. If you do not understand the map documentation and/or arrow functions first refer to:
